                💬 Another good use of all is when you want to share similar data structure
                like when adding pagination metadata to a list
            </li>
            <li>💬 Let's make our character list paginated</li>
            <li>✏️ Add Paginated and CharacterPaginated schemas</li>
            <li>
                💬 Note that our list is just an array which is not a good idea
                as it not extensible without impacting deeply the structure.
                That's why it is recommender to always return data encapsulated in an object
            </li>
            <li>✏️ Use CharactersPaginated in Search characters</li>
            <li>📺 Show Redoc</li>
            <li>💬 If later we have other paginated lists, we can do the same</li>
