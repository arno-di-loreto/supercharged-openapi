            <li>ðŸ’¬ Author of The Design of Web APIs, published by Manning</li>
            <li>
                ðŸ’¬ In my book, there's a chapter about The OpenAPI Specification
                which is a format that allows to describe APIs.
            </li>
            <li>
                ðŸ’¬ It's a must have in your toolbox when working on APIs,
                especially when designing or documenting them.
            </li>
            <li>
                ðŸ’¬ With this session, my first ever live coding one,
                I want to show you how to take full advantage of this format.
            </li>
            <li>
                ðŸ’¬ So let's go and create the OpenAPI specification document of an API
                providing information about characters
                and toys of the Masters of the Universe franchise
